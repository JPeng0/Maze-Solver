# Maze-Solver
#
##### Written in 2 days for class skill test project
##### Takes maze string followed by '\n' from stdin, breaks into a m*n char** array and solves for shortest path from S to D
##### Accounts for up to 10 pairs of portals(0-9) and outputs string of directions to reach destination, accounting for portal teleportation
##### Uses simple BFS with visited array and visiting queue, which were custom implemented because C sucks
